# Anchor interest stability simulation

The interest rate of Anchor protocol powered by both borrowing interest and staking reward from collateral asset. Anchor protocol changes the value 'a', which is the key parameter of Interest stability mechanism that determines what portion of the staking reward goes to the borrower and lender to adjust the interest rate during different market cycle.

In this research, we see how the Anchor interest stability mechanism runs in different market situations. You can check 'Interest stability simulation' pdf file to see the result of research.
